# Attendance-system-main using facial recognition
In this project we have created a "Automated Attendance Systek Based On Face Recognition".The application includes facial identification of students for creating ease in attendance management.

TECHNOLOGY USED:
1.Streamlit for application
2.OpenCV for taking images and face recognition 
3.CSV, Numpy, Pandas, datetime etc. for other purposes.

Instructions to run
1.Clone the project and download the source code.
2.Once inside the folder, run the following command: streamlit run '.\p1 
  html\Attendance-System-Project-main\4. Deployment\Home_Page.py'
3.Go to: localhost:8504 in your browser
4.First Register yourself by clicking on option Add_new_student
5.Mark your attendance by clicking on Intiate Attendance on Attendance_with 
 camera.
6.We can also mark attendance using Manual attendance

Error Analysis
The possible reasons for the errors could be:
1. Change in the personâ€™s face over time - considerable facial change from the photo used in training.
2.Two or more similar-looking people - If there are multiple people with similar faces, then the model may wrongly classify a person as someone else.
